Steps to Assess and Minimize Impact
Identify Foreign Key Constraints To find out which tables have foreign key relationships to KEYCLOAK_GROUP, you can query the INFORMATION_SCHEMA in MySQL:
sql
Copy code
SELECT 
  TABLE_NAME, 
  COLUMN_NAME, 
  CONSTRAINT_NAME, 
  REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME, 
  REFERENCED_COLUMN_NAME
FROM 
  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE
WHERE 
  REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME = 'KEYCLOAK_GROUP'
  AND TABLE_SCHEMA = 'keycloak_database_name';
Replace keycloak_database_name with your actual Keycloak schema name. This query will list all tables, columns, and constraints that reference KEYCLOAK_GROUP.
Understand the Purpose of the Relationships After identifying the tables with foreign key relationships, analyze how these tables use the group data:
Group-Role Mappings: There might be a table like KEYCLOAK_GROUP_ROLE_MAPPING that maps groups to roles.
Group-Member Mappings: There may be tables like USER_GROUP_MEMBERSHIP that map users to groups.
Realm Settings: Groups are often tied to realms, so other tables referencing realms might have an indirect impact.
Check for Orphaned Data Before deleting any rows, it's crucial to check if the group records you plan to delete have dependencies in other tables. For example, if you plan to delete a group with ID = 'duplicate_group_id', you should search for references in related tables:
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM USER_GROUP_MEMBERSHIP WHERE GROUP_ID = 'duplicate_group_id';
SELECT * FROM KEYCLOAK_GROUP_ROLE_MAPPING WHERE GROUP_ID = 'duplicate_group_id';
Make sure that deleting a group doesn't leave orphaned records in other tables.
Option: Soft Delete (Mark as Inactive) If you are concerned about the impact on related tables, consider performing a "soft delete" instead of an actual delete:
Add a new status column like DELETED to the KEYCLOAK_GROUP table.
Mark duplicate records as deleted rather than removing them completely.
This approach retains the data for future analysis while avoiding breaking references in other tables.
Delete Rows Carefully If you are confident that deleting the duplicate rows won't cause issues in other tables, proceed to delete them using a DELETE query. You can back up the rows by copying them into a temporary table before deletion if necessary.
Re-test System Behavior Post-Deletion After making any deletions, restart Keycloak and test all functionalities:
Verify that user-group memberships are intact.
Check that group-based permissions and roles are functioning as expected.
Ensure there are no errors when interacting with any part of the application that involves groups.
Summary
Deleting duplicates from KEYCLOAK_GROUP can affect other tables that have foreign key relationships or references to the group entries. Use caution by:

Identifying and understanding all related tables.
Checking for orphaned records before deletion.
Testing all related functionalities in Keycloak after any changes.
If you are unsure about the impact, it's better to go through a test environment or consult any Keycloak documentation regarding schema changes between your current version and the version you are upgrading to.






You said:
excellent, can you provide a query to create a backup table first for this keycloak_group
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Certainly! To create a backup of the KEYCLOAK_GROUP table in MySQL, you can use a query that creates a new table with the same structure and data. Here's the query to do that:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE KEYCLOAK_GROUP_BACKUP AS 
SELECT * 
FROM KEYCLOAK_GROUP;
Explanation
CREATE TABLE KEYCLOAK_GROUP_BACKUP: Creates a new table named KEYCLOAK_GROUP_BACKUP.
AS SELECT * FROM KEYCLOAK_GROUP: Copies all the data and the structure from KEYCLOAK_GROUP into the backup table.
This command will create a backup table containing all the current data in KEYCLOAK_GROUP.

Notes:
The new table (KEYCLOAK_GROUP_BACKUP) will contain all the data from the original KEYCLOAK_GROUP, but it will not copy any foreign keys, indexes, or constraints that exist on the original table.
If you also want to include the table structure with constraints and indexes, you will need to do a more comprehensive export and re-import, but this is generally sufficient for basic data backup.
If You Want to Include Table Structure (Indexes, Constraints)
If you need to ensure the backup table includes the indexes and constraints, you can use a two-step process:

Create the Table with the Same Structure:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE KEYCLOAK_GROUP_BACKUP LIKE KEYCLOAK_GROUP;
Copy the Data into the New Table:
sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO KEYCLOAK_GROUP_BACKUP SELECT * FROM KEYCLOAK_GROUP;
This will ensure that the KEYCLOAK_GROUP_BACKUP has the same structure, including indexes and constraints, as the original KEYCLOAK_GROUP.

Make sure to verify the backup data after running these commands to ensure it's complete and accurate before making any changes to the original KEYCLOAK_GROUP.

Steps to Identify the Troubled Table
Search for Tables with a SIBLING_NAMES Constraint or Similar Columns You can search through the tables to find those that have columns related to sibling_name or similar names. To check the structure of each table:
sql
Copy code
SHOW CREATE TABLE table_name;
Look for a column or constraint related to sibling_name or anything that matches the context of master-SG_EU_DEV_JIRA_Developers.
Look for Common Keycloak Tables That Might Relate to Groups or Roles Since the error message indicates a naming conflict, focus on tables that are likely to store groups, roles, or permissions. Common tables in Keycloak that could be related include:
GROUP
ROLE
REALM
CLIENT_ROLE
REALM_ROLE
Check these tables specifically by describing their structure and looking for constraints or indices that match SIBLING_NAMES.

For example:

sql
Copy code
SHOW CREATE TABLE GROUP;
sql
Copy code
SHOW CREATE TABLE ROLE;
Search for Constraints or Indexes by Name If you suspect that the SIBLING_NAMES might be a constraint or index name, you can run a query to list all indexes and constraints in your schema:
sql
Copy code
SELECT 
  TABLE_NAME, CONSTRAINT_NAME, CONSTRAINT_TYPE
FROM 
  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS
WHERE 
  CONSTRAINT_SCHEMA = 'keycloak_database_name' 
  AND CONSTRAINT_NAME LIKE '%SIBLING_NAMES%';
Replace keycloak_database_name with your schema name. This query will list any constraints or indexes that have a name similar to SIBLING_NAMES.
Identify Duplicate Data in the Problematic Table Once you have identified the table associated with SIBLING_NAMES, find the duplicate entries that are causing the error. For example, if you identified the GROUP table as problematic:
sql
Copy code
SELECT sibling_name_column, COUNT(*)
FROM GROUP
GROUP BY sibling_name_column
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
Replace sibling_name_column with the actual column name causing the duplicate issue. This will give you a list of duplicate entries.
Review and Resolve Duplicate Data Once you identify the problematic table and column:
Review the duplicate entries and decide whether to remove or modify them to ensure uniqueness.
Remove or Update Duplicates using DELETE or UPDATE queries as appropriate.

Option 1: Using a Self-Signed ClusterIssuer with cert-manager
You can create a self-signed certificate using cert-manager with a ClusterIssuer of type selfSigned.

Step 1: Create a Self-Signed ClusterIssuer

Apply the following YAML to create a ClusterIssuer that will generate self-signed certificates:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-issuer
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
Save this to a file (e.g., selfsigned-issuer.yaml) and apply it:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f selfsigned-issuer.yaml
Step 2: Create a Certificate Resource Using the Self-Signed Issuer

Use this ClusterIssuer to create a certificate for your Keycloak ingress:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: keycloak-selfsigned-cert
  namespace: keycloak-edp  # Your Keycloak namespace
spec:
  secretName: keycloak-tls  # The secret where the certificate will be stored
  duration: 8760h # 1 year
  renewBefore: 360h # 15 days before expiration
  commonName: <your-domain>  # Replace with your domain
  dnsNames:
    - <your-domain>  # Replace with your domain
  issuerRef:
    name: selfsigned-issuer
    kind: ClusterIssuer
Save this as keycloak-selfsigned-certificate.yaml and apply it:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f keycloak-selfsigned-certificate.yaml
Step 3: Use the Generated Secret in Your Ingress

Once the certificate is generated, update your ingress resource to use the keycloak-tls secret:

yaml
Copy code
tls:
  - hosts:
      - <your-domain>  # Replace with your domain
    secretName: keycloak-tls
Apply your ingress resource:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f keycloak-ingress.yaml

Hi Casey and Rajesh,

Thank you, Casey, for testing the new non-productive deployment of Keycloak. Your efforts have been crucial in moving this forward.

Next Steps:

As we discussed, the next step is to switch the non-prod URLs, test them, and confirm everything is working as expected.
Once the non-prod URLs are verified, we can proceed to plan for the production deployment and swap the prod URLs accordingly.
Request for Support:

I can take care of changing the internal URL. However, we will need assistance from your team, Casey, for swapping the external URLs.
Can you please share and suggest the process for this?
Rajesh:

Could you please review and confirm the process for Keycloak swapping/migrating to the new setup for both non-prod and prod environments?
Looking forward to your input and guidance on the next steps.

Best regards,
Kiran

Great approach! Below is a step-by-step guide on how to proceed with uninstalling your current ingress-nginx Helm release and then reinstalling it to use an existing AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB):

Step 1: Uninstall the Existing ingress-nginx Helm Chart
Uninstall the current ingress-nginx Helm release to clean up any existing resources, including the Classic Load Balancer (CLB):

bash
Copy code
helm uninstall ingress-nginx -n external-nginx-new
This will delete all resources created by the chart, including the CLB.
Ensure that there are no dependencies relying on this ingress setup before proceeding.
Step 2: Prepare a values.yaml for the New Helm Release
Create a values.yaml file to configure the new ingress-nginx installation. This file will set up the Service to use an existing AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB).

Here's an example values.yaml:

yaml
Copy code
controller:
  service:
    type: LoadBalancer
    annotations:
      # Use AWS NLB (Network Load Balancer) instead of the default ALB/CLB
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: "nlb"

      # Point to the existing NLB ARN
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-arn: "arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:<region>:<account-id>:loadbalancer/net/<nlb-name>"

      # If the NLB is internal (optional)
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal: "true"

    # External traffic policy to preserve client IP (optional)
    externalTrafficPolicy: Local

  # Adjust other settings like replica count, resources, etc., as necessary
  replicaCount: 2
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: "100m"
      memory: "128Mi"
    limits:
      cpu: "200m"
      memory: "256Mi"
Replace the placeholders:

<region>: Your AWS region (e.g., us-west-2)
<account-id>: Your AWS account ID
<nlb-name>: The name of your existing NLB
Step 3: Install the New Helm Release
Now, install the ingress-nginx Helm release with the modified values.yaml that points to your existing NLB:

bash
Copy code
helm upgrade --install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx \
  --repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx \
  -f values.yaml \
  -n external-nginx-new
This command will:

Install a new ingress-nginx Helm release in the external-nginx-new namespace.
Configure the Service for the ingress controller to use the existing AWS NLB.
Step 4: Verify the New Setup
After the installation, verify that the ingress-nginx service is correctly using the existing NLB:

Check the Service Configuration:
bash
Copy code
kubectl get svc -n external-nginx-new
Confirm the NLB Association in AWS:
Go to the AWS Console > EC2 > Load Balancers.
Confirm that the existing NLB is correctly associated with the new ingress-nginx service.
Check for Successful Deployment:
bash
Copy code
helm status ingress-nginx -n external-nginx-new
This should display the status of the new Helm release, confirming that the ingress controller is running as expected.
Validate Traffic Routing: Test any DNS or routing configurations to ensure that traffic is being correctly handled by the NLB and forwarded to your ingress-nginx controller.
Summary of the Process
Uninstall the current ingress-nginx Helm release to clean up resources.
Create a values.yaml to configure ingress-nginx with an existing AWS NLB.
Reinstall ingress-nginx using Helm, ensuring it points to the NLB as specified in the values.yaml.
Verify and validate the setup to ensure the ingress controller is functioning correctly with the existing NLB.
This approach ensures that you're using the existing NLB efficiently and that no unnecessary load balancers are left behind. Let me know if you need any help with customization or additional configurations!






You said:
excellent, can you also provide steps for a sample hello world nginx app to be deployed with helm chart and pointing it with the ingress we create above
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Of course! Below are the steps to deploy a simple "Hello World" Nginx application using a Helm chart and configure it to be exposed via the ingress-nginx controller you just set up.

Step 1: Create a New Namespace for the Hello World App
First, let's create a namespace for the Hello World application:

bash
Copy code
kubectl create namespace hello-world
Step 2: Create a Simple values.yaml for the Nginx Hello World App
Here is an example values.yaml file to use with Helm for the Nginx deployment, which includes a basic Deployment and Service:

yaml
Copy code
replicaCount: 2

image:
  repository: nginx
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  tag: "latest"

service:
  type: ClusterIP
  port: 80

ingress:
  enabled: true
  annotations:
    # Use this annotation if you're using the Nginx ingress controller
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
  hosts:
    - host: hello-world.yourdomain.com  # Change to your domain or IP
      paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: Prefix
  tls: []  # You can add TLS configuration if required

resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "100m"
    memory: "128Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "200m"
    memory: "256Mi"
Make sure to replace hello-world.yourdomain.com with your domain or a DNS record pointing to your existing NLB.

Step 3: Create a Basic Helm Chart for the Nginx App
Create a basic Helm chart scaffold for the Nginx "Hello World" app:

bash
Copy code
helm create hello-world-nginx
This will generate a scaffold chart directory with a default template for deployment, service, etc.

Step 4: Customize the Helm Chart Template
Navigate to the hello-world-nginx directory created by the above command. Replace the content in values.yaml with the sample content provided in Step 2. This will define your Deployment, Service, and Ingress.

Make sure to review and adjust the generated templates/deployment.yaml and templates/service.yaml as necessary to align with the configurations you want, but the default scaffold generated by helm create should suffice for this example.

Step 5: Deploy the Nginx App Using Helm
Install the Helm chart using the custom values.yaml file into the hello-world namespace:

bash
Copy code
helm install hello-world-nginx ./hello-world-nginx -f values.yaml -n hello-world
This command will:

Deploy a simple Nginx "Hello World" application as a Deployment.
Create a Service to expose the pods internally.
Create an Ingress resource to expose the application externally via the existing NLB, handled by ingress-nginx.
Step 6: Verify the Deployment
Check that the deployment, service, and ingress have been created successfully:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods -n hello-world
kubectl get svc -n hello-world
kubectl get ingress -n hello-world
You should see:

The Nginx pods running.
A ClusterIP service exposing the Nginx deployment.
An Ingress pointing to the service and exposing it through the ingress-nginx controller.
Step 7: Access the Hello World Nginx App
Make sure that your domain hello-world.yourdomain.com is pointing to the DNS name of your existing NLB in AWS.
If you're using an IP or a temporary setup, you can also access the app by the NLB’s DNS name directly.
Once DNS is set up, access your Nginx "Hello World" app in a browser:
arduino
Copy code
http://hello-world.yourdomain.com
This should display the default Nginx welcome page or any content you customize inside the Nginx container.
Summary
Create a Helm chart for the "Hello World" Nginx app.
Customize the values.yaml to define the deployment, service, and ingress.
Deploy the Helm chart into the hello-world namespace.
Point the Ingress to your existing NLB using the ingress-nginx controller.
Access the app via the domain or NLB DNS name.
This setup provides an easy way to deploy a sample Nginx "Hello World" app exposed through the ingress-nginx controller pointing to an existing AWS NLB. You can now customize the Nginx content, scaling, and ingress rules as per your needs!







------------
The command you've provided is a Helm command that combines installing and upgrading a release of the ingress-nginx chart. Here's a detailed breakdown of each part:

bash
Copy code
helm upgrade --install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx --repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx -n external-nginx-new
Explanation
helm upgrade --install:
upgrade: This command is used to upgrade an existing Helm release to a newer version or to update its configuration. If the release does not exist, it will throw an error unless --install is also used.
--install: With this flag, Helm will install the release if it doesn't already exist. This makes the command "idempotent," meaning it can be run multiple times safely; if the release exists, it upgrades, and if not, it installs it.
ingress-nginx:
This is the release name. A release is a specific deployment of a chart, and it has a unique name. In this example, ingress-nginx is the name of the release being created or upgraded.
ingress-nginx:
This is the chart name. Helm uses this name to fetch the chart from the specified repository (--repo). Here, it indicates that you want to install or upgrade the ingress-nginx chart.
--repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx:
--repo: This flag specifies the repository URL from which to fetch the chart.
The URL https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx is the official repository for the ingress-nginx Helm chart. This option allows you to fetch the chart directly from the URL without needing to add the repo to your local Helm repo list first.
-n external-nginx-new:
-n or --namespace: Specifies the Kubernetes namespace into which the release should be installed or upgraded.
Here, the namespace is external-nginx-new. If this namespace does not exist, Helm will not create it, and you'll need to create it beforehand using:
bash
Copy code
kubectl create namespace external-nginx-new
Summary
The command is attempting to either upgrade an existing ingress-nginx release or install a new one if it doesn't already exist in the external-nginx-new namespace. It fetches the ingress-nginx chart from the specified repository URL https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx.

When to Use This Command
Initial Deployment: When deploying ingress-nginx for the first time.
Upgrade Existing Deployment: When you want to upgrade an existing ingress-nginx release to a newer version or update its configuration.
Idempotency: If you're scripting Helm deployments, this command is helpful because you don't need to worry about whether the release already exists; it handles both installation and upgrades.
Make sure the namespace exists before running the command if it's not already present. If you don't specify the -n flag, Helm will install the release in the default namespace.






You said:
ok I used the above helm command to create an nginx but modified later, can an update to it restores it back ?
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Yes, running the helm upgrade --install command again with the correct values in the values.yaml file or with updated parameters in the command will "restore" your ingress-nginx release back to the configuration defined in the chart and its parameters. Essentially, Helm will attempt to make the running resources match what is described in the chart and the values provided.

How to Restore the Original State
Reapply the Original Helm Chart Configuration: If you have the original values.yaml file or remember the parameters you used when you first installed the ingress-nginx, you can reapply them. For example:
bash
Copy code
helm upgrade --install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx --repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx -f original-values.yaml -n external-nginx-new
This will ensure that the current ingress-nginx release is brought back in line with the original state described in original-values.yaml.
Use --reset-values to Revert to Chart Defaults: If you've modified values that you want to discard and restore to chart defaults:
bash
Copy code
helm upgrade --install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx --repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx -n external-nginx-new --reset-values
The --reset-values flag will discard any overrides or customizations applied in previous upgrades and restore the release to its original chart default values.
Manually Delete Unwanted Changes: If specific resources were manually changed outside of Helm (e.g., modified with kubectl apply), those changes will not be tracked by Helm. In such cases:
Delete the resources manually to allow Helm to recreate them as per the chart.
Alternatively, if you don't remember the exact modifications, you can delete the entire ingress-nginx release and reinstall it to start fresh:
bash
Copy code
helm uninstall ingress-nginx -n external-nginx-new
helm install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx --repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx -f original-values.yaml -n external-nginx-new
Check for Changes Using helm diff (Optional): If you're unsure what changes will be applied, you can use the helm diff plugin (if installed) to compare the current state of the release with the desired state:
bash
Copy code
helm diff upgrade ingress-nginx ingress-nginx --repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx -n external-nginx-new
This will show you what changes the upgrade command will apply before making them.
Summary
Running the helm upgrade --install command with the correct values or defaults will restore your ingress-nginx setup to match the desired configuration described in the chart. Just ensure you provide the correct values.yaml or parameters that reflect the original or desired state of your ingress-nginx deployment.






You said:
excellent can you also provide an upgrade for this helm chart to connect to existing AWS NLB rather than creating a new one
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
To upgrade the existing ingress-nginx Helm release to use an existing AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) instead of creating a new one, you need to modify the values.yaml to include annotations pointing to your existing NLB. Below are the steps to achieve this:

Steps to Upgrade ingress-nginx to Use an Existing NLB
Edit or Create a Custom values.yaml: If you haven't already, create or update your custom values.yaml that you will use to upgrade your Helm release:
bash
Copy code
helm show values ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx > values.yaml
Open this values.yaml in a text editor and make the following modifications to connect to the existing NLB.
Configure the service Section to Use the Existing NLB: Locate the controller.service section in the values.yaml file. You need to modify the annotations and settings to ensure that it connects to the existing NLB. Below is an example configuration:
yaml
Copy code
controller:
  service:
    type: LoadBalancer
    annotations:
      # Use AWS NLB instead of the default ALB
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: "nlb"

      # Point to the existing NLB ARN
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-arn: "arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:<region>:<account-id>:loadbalancer/net/<nlb-name>"

      # Optional: If your NLB is internal
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal: "true"

    # Set externalTrafficPolicy to preserve client IP (optional)
    externalTrafficPolicy: Local
Replace the placeholders in aws-load-balancer-arn with the appropriate values:

<region>: Your AWS region (e.g., us-west-2).
<account-id>: Your AWS account ID.
<nlb-name>: The name of your NLB.
This configuration ensures that the ingress-nginx service uses the existing NLB instead of creating a new one.
Upgrade the Helm Release with the Updated values.yaml: Now, use the helm upgrade command to apply the changes to your existing ingress-nginx release:
bash
Copy code
helm upgrade ingress-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx -f values.yaml -n external-nginx-new
This command will update your existing Helm release (ingress-nginx) in the external-nginx-new namespace using the modified values.yaml.
Validate the Changes: After the upgrade, check if the service has been correctly updated to use the existing NLB:
bash
Copy code
kubectl get svc -n external-nginx-new
You should see that the ingress-nginx service is of type LoadBalancer and the NLB details match the existing load balancer configuration you specified.
Optional: Using --set Flags (Alternative to values.yaml)
If you prefer to make the changes without using a values.yaml, you can directly use the --set flags in your Helm command:

bash
Copy code
helm upgrade ingress-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx \
  --repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx \
  --set controller.service.type=LoadBalancer \
  --set controller.service.annotations."service\.beta\.kubernetes\.io/aws-load-balancer-type"="nlb" \
  --set controller.service.annotations."service\.beta\.kubernetes\.io/aws-load-balancer-arn"="arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:<region>:<account-id>:loadbalancer/net/<nlb-name>" \
  --set controller.service.externalTrafficPolicy=Local \
  -n external-nginx-new
Note: Using --set directly on the command line is suitable for quick changes but might become cumbersome for more extensive configurations. It's usually better to maintain these changes in a values.yaml.

Summary
Update the values.yaml to include annotations for connecting to the existing NLB.
Upgrade the Helm release with helm upgrade using the updated values.yaml.
Validate the changes to ensure the existing NLB is correctly associated with the ingress-nginx service.



----------
2. Add the Helm Repository for Keycloak:

The official Codecentric Helm chart is a good starting point. Add the repository:

bash
Copy code
helm repo add codecentric https://codecentric.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
3. Prepare a Custom values.yaml File:

Create a values.yaml file to override the default settings for the Keycloak Helm chart. Here’s an example of what this file could look like, focusing on the ingress and connecting it to the existing ELB.

yaml
Copy code
keycloak:
  replicas: 2
  baseUrl: https://keycloak.yourdomain.com  # Base URL to be used for Keycloak

ingress:
  enabled: true
  hosts:
    - host: keycloak.yourdomain.com
      paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: ImplementationSpecific
  annotations:
    # Adjust annotations based on your ingress controller and AWS settings
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTPS"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: "10m"
    # Add any additional annotations as needed for your existing ELB settings

service:
  type: ClusterIP  # Do not create a new load balancer
Set the host to the domain name that will be pointed to your ELB.
Add any necessary annotations based on your ingress controller and ELB configuration.
If you are using Nginx as the ingress controller, ensure the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol matches your protocol (HTTP/HTTPS).
4. Deploy the Keycloak Helm Chart in the New Namespace:

Use Helm to deploy the Keycloak instance into the keycloak namespace with your custom values.yaml file.

bash
Copy code
helm upgrade --install keycloak codecentric/keycloak -f values.yaml -n keycloak
5. Set Up DNS to Point to the Existing ELB:

If you haven't already, configure your DNS (e.g., using Route 53) to point the domain (keycloak.yourdomain.com) to the existing ELB's DNS name. This will route traffic from your domain to the ELB, and then to the Keycloak ingress.

6. Verify the Ingress Configuration:

Check that the ingress resource has been correctly created and is pointing to the ELB. Use the following command:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get ingress -n keycloak
You should see an ingress resource with the host configured as keycloak.yourdomain.com.

7. Check the Keycloak Pods and Services:

Confirm that the Keycloak pods are running successfully:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods -n keycloak
And verify the services:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get svc -n keycloak
8. Access Keycloak through the ELB and Domain:

You should now be able to access Keycloak through the domain https://keycloak.yourdomain.com. The ingress will route traffic from the ELB to your Keycloak service.

Optional Steps (For Further Customization):
TLS Configuration: If you want to enable TLS for secure connections, ensure your ingress has the correct certificate setup. You can add this under ingress.tls in the values.yaml:
yaml
Copy code
ingress:
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - keycloak.yourdomain.com
      secretName: keycloak-tls-secret  # Replace with your TLS secret name
Scaling and Resource Limits: Modify the replica count and resource limits as per your workload:
yaml
Copy code
keycloak:
  replicas: 3
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: "500m"
      memory: "1Gi"
    limits:
      cpu: "1000m"
      memory: "2Gi"



--------
Step-by-Step Deployment Process
1. Deploy Cert-Manager

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-issuer
  namespace: cert-manager
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
Apply this configuration:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f issuer.yaml
Verify Cert-Manager: Make sure the cert-manager pods are running:
bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods -n cert-manager
2. Deploy Internal Nginx Ingress Controller

Create a Namespace for Internal Nginx:
bash
Copy code
kubectl create namespace internal-nginx
Deploy Internal Nginx with Helm:
bash
Copy code
helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
helm repo update
helm install internal-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx \
  --namespace internal-nginx \
  --set controller.service.annotations."service\.beta\.kubernetes\.io/aws-load-balancer-internal"="true"
Verify Deployment: Check that the internal-nginx ingress controller is up and running:
bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods -n internal-nginx
3. Deploy External Nginx Ingress Controller

Create a Namespace for External Nginx:
bash
Copy code
kubectl create namespace external-nginx
Deploy External Nginx with Helm:
bash
Copy code
helm install external-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx \
  --namespace external-nginx
Verify Deployment: Check that the external-nginx ingress controller is up and running:
bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods -n external-nginx
4. Deploy External-DNS

Create a Namespace for External-DNS:
bash
Copy code
kubectl create namespace external-dns
Deploy External-DNS with Helm: Configure the correct DNS provider (AWS Route 53, Google Cloud DNS, etc.), and replace <provider-credentials> with your actual provider credentials.
Example for AWS Route 53:

helm repo add external-dns https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/external-dns/
helm repo update
helm install external-dns external-dns/external-dns --namespace external-dns



bash
Copy code
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
helm install external-dns bitnami/external-dns \
  --namespace external-dns \
  --set provider=aws \
  --set aws.credentials.secretKey=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY> \
  --set aws.credentials.accessKey=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
Verify External-DNS Deployment: Ensure external-dns is running and can interact with your DNS provider:
bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods -n external-dns
5. Deploy a Sample Nginx Application

Create a Namespace for the Sample App:
bash
Copy code
kubectl create namespace sample-app
Deploy a Sample Nginx Application:
yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-sample
  namespace: sample-app
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-sample
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-sample
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
Apply this configuration:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f nginx-sample-deployment.yaml
Expose the Application through an Ingress Resource: Create an ingress resource to route traffic through external-nginx with TLS provided by cert-manager:
yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: nginx-sample-ingress
  namespace: sample-app
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/issuer: "selfsigned-issuer"
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - <your-domain.com>
    secretName: nginx-sample-tls
  rules:
  - host: <your-domain.com>
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: nginx-sample
            port:
              number: 80
Apply this configuration:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f nginx-sample-ingress.yaml
Verify Certificate Issuance: Check that cert-manager issues a certificate and stores it in a secret:
bash
Copy code
kubectl get certificate -n sample-app
kubectl get secret nginx-sample-tls -n sample-app
6. Test Access to the Application

DNS Configuration:
Ensure that external-dns has correctly created the DNS record for <your-domain.com>.
Check the DNS entry in your provider (e.g., Route 53).
Access the Application:
Once the DNS is correctly set up, navigate to https://<your-domain.com> in your browser.
Verify that you see the Nginx welcome page served over HTTPS.
Summary:
Deploy cert-manager to handle certificate creation.
Deploy internal and external Nginx ingress controllers for private and public traffic.
Deploy external-dns to automate DNS management.
Deploy a sample Nginx application and expose it through the external ingress controller.
Test access through the DNS and verify the certificate.
This process sets up a robust foundation for handling internal and external traffic with proper SSL/TLS termination using cert-manager.






You said:
how do I clean ups the existing namespace ? is it a better idea if I do not want it anymore ?
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
If you no longer need the existing namespaces, it's a good idea to clean them up to free up resources and reduce clutter in your EKS cluster. Here's how you can safely clean up and delete a namespace and all its associated resources.

Steps to Clean Up and Delete a Namespace
Back Up Important Resources (if necessary):
Before deleting anything, ensure that you have backed up any important resources (e.g., ConfigMaps, Secrets, PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs), data stored in external storage).
Delete Resources in the Namespace:
To avoid lingering resources, delete all the resources in the namespace before deleting the namespace itself.
You can use kubectl delete to remove different types of resources.
bash
Copy code
kubectl delete all --all -n <namespace-name>
This command deletes all resource types (deployments, services, pods, replicasets, ingresses, etc.) within the namespace.
Check for and Delete CRDs and Other Non-Standard Resources:
Cert-manager, external-dns, and ingress controllers often create custom resource definitions (CRDs). List and delete them if they’re only used within this namespace.
bash
Copy code
kubectl get crds | grep <namespace-name>
Delete any relevant CRDs:
bash
Copy code
kubectl delete crd <crd-name>
Delete PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) (if used):
PVCs are not automatically deleted when a namespace is deleted. If your apps are using PVCs, list and delete them manually.
bash
Copy code
kubectl get pvc -n <namespace-name>
kubectl delete pvc --all -n <namespace-name>
Delete the Namespace:
Once you've ensured that all resources within the namespace are deleted, delete the namespace itself.
bash
Copy code
kubectl delete namespace <namespace-name>
This will remove any remaining resources and metadata associated with the namespace.
Verify Deletion:
It might take a moment for Kubernetes to clean up everything. Check the status of the namespace deletion:
bash
Copy code
kubectl get namespace <namespace-name>
Considerations:
Finalizers: Sometimes, resources within a namespace have finalizers that prevent their deletion. If a namespace gets stuck in the Terminating state:
Check which resources are blocking the deletion:
bash
Copy code
kubectl get namespace <namespace-name> -o json
Remove finalizers if necessary by editing the namespace:
bash
Copy code
kubectl edit namespace <namespace-name>
Find the "finalizers" section and remove it, then save the file.
Double-Check for Shared Resources: If any resources in the namespace are shared across other services or namespaces, make sure deleting the namespace will not impact them.

Replace <access_key_id> and <username> with appropriate values.
Validate Access Keys are Deactivated:
bash
Copy code
aws iam list-access-keys --user-name <username> --query 'AccessKeyMetadata[*].[AccessKeyId,Status]' --output table
Ensure the status is Inactive.
Task 2: Remove EKS Clusters
Step-by-Step Technical Steps:

List EKS Clusters:
Identify Existing EKS Clusters:
bash
Copy code
aws eks list-clusters --output table
This command lists all active EKS clusters.
Delete EKS Node Groups (if present):
List Node Groups for the Cluster:
bash
Copy code
aws eks list-nodegroups --cluster-name <cluster_name> --output table
Replace <cluster_name> with the name of the EKS cluster.
Delete Node Groups:
bash
Copy code
aws eks delete-nodegroup --cluster-name <cluster_name> --nodegroup-name <nodegroup_name>
Replace <cluster_name> and <nodegroup_name> with respective values.
Delete EKS Cluster:
Delete the EKS Cluster:
bash
Copy code
aws eks delete-cluster --name <cluster_name>
Replace <cluster_name> with the appropriate cluster name.
Clean Up Resources Associated with the EKS Cluster:
Delete Associated Load Balancers: List load balancers associated with the cluster and manually delete them if they do not auto-clean.
bash
Copy code
aws elb describe-load-balancers --query 'LoadBalancerDescriptions[*].[LoadBalancerName]' --output table
Then, delete using:
bash
Copy code
aws elb delete-load-balancer --load-balancer-name <load_balancer_name>
Delete Security Groups: Identify and delete security groups associated with the EKS cluster.
bash
Copy code
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query 'SecurityGroups[*].[GroupId,GroupName]' --output table
Then delete:
bash
Copy code
aws ec2 delete-security-group --group-id <security_group_id>
Task 3: Technical Validation of the Decommissioning Process
Step-by-Step Validation:

Validate EC2 Instances are Stopped:
Check the Status of EC2 Instances:
bash
Copy code
aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,State.Name]' --output table
Ensure all instances are in the stopped state.
Validate IAM Keys are Deactivated:
List and Check Access Key Status:
bash
Copy code
aws iam list-access-keys --user-name <username> --query 'AccessKeyMetadata[*].[AccessKeyId,Status]' --output table
Ensure that all keys have a status of Inactive.
Validate EKS Clusters and Resources are Deleted:
Check for Remaining EKS Clusters:
bash
Copy code
aws eks list-clusters --output table
Ensure no clusters are listed.
Check for Remaining Node Groups:
bash
Copy code
aws eks list-nodegroups --cluster-name <cluster_name> --output table
Ensure no node groups are listed for the deleted cluster.
Check for Remaining Load Balancers:
bash
Copy code

Ensure no associated load balancers exist.
Check for Orphaned Security Groups:
bash
Copy code
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query 'SecurityGroups[*].[GroupId,GroupName]' --output table
Ensure all unused security groups are deleted.
Monitor CloudWatch Logs for Anomalies:
Check for any unauthorized access or failures during decommissioning via CloudWatch logs:
bash
Copy code
aws logs describe-log-groups --query 'logGroups[*].logGroupName' --output table
This step-by-step approach covers the technical process for stopping EC2 instances, deactivating IAM keys, removing EKS clusters, and then validating the success of these actions to ensure a smooth decommissioning process.



----
High-Level Process for AWS Account Decommissioning
Stop EC2 Instances:
Identify Instances: List all active EC2 instances in the account.
Notify Stakeholders: Inform all relevant teams about the scheduled downtime.
Stop Instances: Use AWS CLI/console to stop EC2 instances.
Validate: Confirm that all instances have stopped by checking their status.
Deactivate AWS IAM Access Keys:
List Active Keys: Identify all active IAM access keys in the account.
Notify Users: Inform users of impending key deactivation.
Deactivate Keys: Use AWS CLI/console to deactivate (not delete) access keys.
Verify: Ensure that all access keys are marked as “Inactive”.
Remove EKS Clusters:
Identify Clusters: List all active EKS clusters.
Backup Data: If needed, back up critical data, configurations, and node groups.
Delete EKS Clusters: Use AWS CLI/console to delete the EKS clusters.
Cleanup Resources: Ensure associated resources like node groups, security groups, and load balancers are cleaned up.
Verify: Confirm that the clusters and resources have been removed.
Change Plan
Pre-Change Notifications:
Notify all stakeholders and AWS account users regarding the decommissioning process, including the date, time, and expected impact.
Change Execution:
Stop EC2 Instances: Confirm no critical services are running and stop all instances.
Deactivate IAM Keys: Ensure all access keys are properly deactivated without disrupting remaining resources.
Remove EKS Clusters: Ensure proper backup and data transfer, followed by EKS cluster deletion.
Communication Plan:
Establish communication channels (Slack, email) for immediate status updates during the process.
Post-Change Review:
Review the decommissioning steps to ensure everything was executed as planned.
Blackout/Recovery Plan
Blackout Period Planning:
Define a blackout period when the decommissioning will take place.
Ensure no major deployments, updates, or changes will occur in the account during this period.
Notify stakeholders about the blackout window.
Recovery Steps:
EC2 Instance Restart: If necessary, EC2 instances can be restarted by simply starting them from the AWS console/CLI.
Reactivating IAM Keys: Reactivate deactivated IAM keys if access is required by restoring the key status to "Active".
Restore EKS Cluster: If EKS clusters need to be re-created, ensure backed-up configurations and data are used for redeployment.
Backup & Failover Plans:
Maintain backups of important EKS configurations and EC2 snapshots to ensure a quick recovery in case of failure.
Technical Validation Plan
Pre-Validation:
Identify Critical Services: Ensure no critical services are running on the EC2 instances.
Validate IAM Key Usage: Ensure IAM keys being deactivated are not being actively used by critical processes.
EKS Dependencies: Check for any services that rely on the EKS clusters before deletion.
Post-Validation:
Validate EC2 Shutdown: Verify that no EC2 instances are running post-shutdown.
IAM Key Deactivation: Confirm that all IAM keys have been successfully deactivated and that no access is possible.
Confirm EKS Removal: Ensure that the EKS clusters are no longer available and no associated resources are left behind.
Monitoring:
Use CloudWatch to monitor for any unexpected errors, resource usage, or unauthorized access attempts following the decommissioning.

Based on the image you provided, here are possible answers to the questions from the context of your incident:

What was the issue? (can you please help us in granular details)
The Data Load DAGs were failing at the AWSDataStaging step in the production environment. This failure was causing interruptions in the data pipeline, leading to incomplete or delayed data processing for critical production workloads.
What is the root cause? (can you please help us in granular details)
The root cause of the failure was a paused service in the dts-management EKS cluster (us-east-1 region) due to a change request (CR: CH24001687338). This led to connectivity issues for the Squid proxy and other services depending on this deployment, which directly affected the DAG executions.
What did we do to resolve this?
To resolve the issue, the team identified a working proxy URL (proxy-dts-services.cdp-pci-prod.us-east-1.edp.awscloud.worldpay.com) that had been deployed earlier in the dis-management-services EKS cluster. After switching to this new URL, services were restored, and the DAGs resumed their normal execution.
What change was done? What was the existing code/setup and what is it now (can you please help us in details)?
The change involved updating the proxy URL from proxy.cdp-pci-prod.us-east-1.edp.awscloud.worldpay.com (which was no longer functional due to the paused service in the dts-management cluster) to the new URL proxy-dts-services.cdp-pci-prod.us-east-1.edp.awscloud.worldpay.com. The new URL connects to a service deployed in the dis-management-services EKS cluster. No changes were made to the core infrastructure, except the URL update.
What is the log name that says it's successfully resolved?
The log file indicating successful resolution can be found under the AWSDataStaging step execution logs. Once the new proxy URL was in use, the DAG executions succeeded without errors, and this would be reflected in the specific DAG's success logs.
Did the issue arise due to a past change? If yes, any CR that was associated with this?
Yes, the issue arose due to Change Request (CR: CH24001687338), which paused the deployment of services in the dts-management EKS cluster, rendering the original proxy URL non-functional.
Is there any monitoring setup in place to identify these issues in future?
Yes, we have monitoring in place, including alarms set up in CloudWatch and Prometheus for service health checks and DAG failures. However, based on this incident, we plan to add an additional layer of monitoring for proxy connectivity and EKS service statuses to detect such issues earlier.
Let me know if you'd like any further adjustments or more details added!

Glad to hear that! Feel free to reach out if you need any further assistance or clarifications. I'm here to help!






You said:
Ok we are only concerned and related to the proxy here and no way related to DAG and data load, can you tweak the answers and only provide inputs from our team if necessary and provide our view 
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Got it! Here’s a revised version of the answers focusing solely on the proxy issue and removing any irrelevant details related to DAGs and data loads:

What was the issue? (can you please help us in granular details)
The issue was related to a paused service in the dts-management EKS cluster (us-east-1 region), which caused the proxy URL proxy.cdp-pci-prod.us-east-1.edp.awscloud.worldpay.com to stop working. This affected the ability to route traffic through the proxy in the production environment.
What is the root cause? (can you please help us in granular details)
The root cause of the issue was the pause in services within the dts-management EKS cluster (us-east-1 region), executed as part of Change Request (CR: CH24001687338). As a result, the proxy URL tied to that service became non-functional.
What did we do to resolve this?
To resolve the issue, we directed the traffic to a new proxy URL (proxy-dts-services.cdp-pci-prod.us-east-1.edp.awscloud.worldpay.com), which was previously deployed in the dis-management-services EKS cluster within the same AWS account. This restored proxy functionality.
What change was done? What was the existing code/setup and what is it now (can you please help us in details)?
The existing setup used the proxy URL proxy.cdp-pci-prod.us-east-1.edp.awscloud.worldpay.com, which was tied to the dts-management EKS cluster. After the pause of that service, the setup was updated to use the proxy URL proxy-dts-services.cdp-pci-prod.us-east-1.edp.awscloud.worldpay.com, which connects to the dis-management-services EKS cluster.
What is the log name that says it's successfully resolved?
The proxy connectivity logs, along with EKS service logs, confirm the successful switch to the new proxy URL. There is no specific log name from our side related to this issue beyond monitoring traffic routing through the new proxy URL.
Did the issue arise due to a past change? If yes, any CR that was associated with this?
Yes, the issue arose as a direct result of Change Request (CR: CH24001687338), which paused the deployment in the dts-management EKS cluster and caused the old proxy URL to become non-functional.
Is there any monitoring setup in place to identify these issues in future?
Yes, there is proxy monitoring in place, and alerts for proxy connectivity are integrated with our overall monitoring system. We will review our alerting setup to ensure timely detection of service pauses impacting proxy availability in the future.




----
The proxy URL proxy.cdp-pci-prod.us-east-1.edp.awscloud.worldpay.com is currently non-functional because we paused the service deployed in the dts-management EKS cluster (us-east-1 region) today as part of the Change Request (CR: CH24001687338). The new proxy URL, proxy-dts-services.cdp-pci-prod.us-east-1.edp.awscloud.worldpay.com, had been deployed some time ago in the dis-management-services EKS cluster (us-east-1 region) in the same AWS account, PPRD-ARIC. Since the services were paused today, this caused the connectivity issue you encountered. Now that you have switched to the new URL, the issue has been resolved, and everything should be functioning properly.

---
Log in to the AWS Management Console and locate the EKS Cluster by navigating to the Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
Identify the Node Group and corresponding Auto Scaling Group (ASG) for the EKS cluster.
Open the EC2 Console to verify the correct ASG associated with the nodes (under Auto Scaling Groups).
Use the following AWS CLI command to set the Auto Scaling Group's desired, minimum, and maximum capacities to 0:
bash
Copy code
aws autoscaling update-auto-scaling-group \
    --auto-scaling-group-name <ASG-NAME> \
    --min-size 0 --max-size 0 --desired-capacity 0
After running the command, verify that the EC2 instances are terminating by checking the EC2 Instances in the AWS Console.
Go back to the EKS Console under the Nodes tab and confirm that the node group has no active nodes.
Optionally, delete the node group in EKS by selecting it and choosing Delete in the Node Groups tab.
Monitor the status in both the EC2 and EKS consoles to ensure the nodes have been fully scaled down or deleted as required.

Hi Casey,

As discussed earlier, below is the new URL for Keycloak in the non-prod environment:

[Insert URL here]

Please review the data and other configurations to ensure everything is as expected. If you notice any discrepancies, kindly let us know so we can address them promptly.

We are aware that the Keycloak theme still needs to be updated. Once your validation is complete, we will proceed with updating the theme as part of the next steps.

Additionally, we are continuing discussions regarding the SIEM logs in a parallel thread.

Thanks for your support, and I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,

Step-by-Step Tasks
1. List All Namespaces

First, list all the namespaces in your cluster to identify where your workloads are running.
Command: kubectl get namespaces
2. Scale Down Deployments

For each namespace, scale down all deployments to zero pods.

# Replace <namespace> with the actual namespace
command:
kubectl get deployments -n <namespace> | awk '{if(NR>1)print $1}' | xargs -I {} kubectl scale deployment {} --replicas=0 -n <namespace>

Repeat this for each namespace where you want to pause services.

3. Scale Down StatefulSets

Scale down all StatefulSets to zero pods.


# Replace <namespace> with the actual namespace
Command:
kubectl get statefulsets -n <namespace> | awk '{if(NR>1)print $1}' | xargs -I {} kubectl scale statefulset {} --replicas=0 -n <namespace>

Repeat for each relevant namespace.

4. Scale Down DaemonSets

DaemonSets typically run a pod on every node, so you might want to consider whether you need to scale these down, depending on your use case.

# Replace <namespace> with the actual namespace
Command:
kubectl get daemonsets -n <namespace> | awk '{if(NR>1)print $1}' | xargs -I {} kubectl scale daemonset {} --replicas=0 -n <namespace>

1. Verify Scaling

After scaling down, verify that there are no running pods left in the affected namespaces.

Command:
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>

For EKS clusters, AWS-managed KMS keys can be used, but we can also use Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) if we need more control over the encryption keys. 
AWS-Managed KMS Keys: These are managed entirely by AWS and offer a simpler solution if we do not need to manage the lifecycle of the key directly. 
Customer Managed KMS Keys (CMKs): If we have specific compliance, security, or auditing requirements that require direct control over the encryption keys.
EKS does not have a hard requirement for using CMKs like EC2 may in certain situations, and we can use either AWS-managed keys or CMKs, depending on our needs. If compliance or strict key control is necessary, then using CMKs would be the way to go.

Here's your revised update with the additional section on pending tasks:

Keycloak Migration Feedback: Casey responded positively to the migration plans. He has approved making the necessary changes to the nonprod admin account as required.
SIEM Log Group: Casey mentioned he is only aware of the SIEM log group and does not have further information. We might need to contact the SIEM team for more details; please let me know if you have contact information for them.
URL Sharing: Casey has requested the new URL to be shared for testing in the nonprod environment once the data migration is complete. I confirmed that we would provide the URL for their testing before the official switch over.
Current Data Migration Tasks: I'm working on data migration in the nonprod environment and exploring two paths:
I have prepared export scripts and tried them in the dev environment, but now there seems to be an issue with the nonprod admin login from the backend.
I am currently creating a new Keycloak environment manually and running export scripts during startup from the restored and backup environment.
Additional Pending Tasks:
Update certificates for external access with key factor.
Confirm the current status of SIEM updates, as the existing SIEM does not seem to be functioning properly. Coordination with the SIEM team is needed.
Update Keycloak themes.
Update Keycloak DBA image.
Next Update: I will provide a more detailed update on the data migration process early next week.

AWS's recent forced upgrade of one of our EKS clusters to version 1.22 has highlighted the urgent need to maintain an actively supported and stable environment. We have already observed issues with some applications during restarts due to compatibility challenges with the new Kubernetes version. In light of these issues, we are proactively recommending an upgrade to EKS version 1.23 to mitigate further potential instability, security vulnerabilities, and operational challenges.

AWS's recent forced upgrade of our EKS cluster to version 1.22 has highlighted the importance of maintaining an actively supported and stable environment. As some applications may encounter restart issues due to compatibility with the new Kubernetes version, it is essential that we take proactive steps. Upgrading to EKS version 1.23 will help us avoid potential instability, security risks, and operational challenges.



Why Not Retire the EKS Cluster Instead?

While retiring the EKS cluster and migrating services to a different platform is part of our long-term plan, it is not feasible to do so immediately due to ongoing dependencies by various teams and applications. The primary goal of this upgrade is to maintain a supported and stable environment for current users, ensuring that their operations are not disrupted during the transition to new clusters. This approach gives teams the necessary time to plan and execute their migrations effectively.

Action Plan:

Pre-Upgrade Preparations:
Backup: Complete a full backup of the current cluster state and all application data before starting the upgrade.
Testing: Perform thorough compatibility testing of all applications with EKS version 1.23 in a staging environment to identify and address potential issues.
Communication: Notify all stakeholders and end-users about the planned downtime and its potential impact on services.
Upgrade Execution:
Schedule the upgrade during off-peak hours to minimize disruption.
Monitor the upgrade process closely, with team members on standby to resolve any issues immediately.
Post-Upgrade Validation:
Verify the stability and functionality of all applications post-upgrade.
Conduct a detailed assessment to ensure that no data loss or application issues occurred during the upgrade.
Provide a comprehensive post-upgrade report to all stakeholders.
Stakeholder Actions Needed:

We request all stakeholders to promptly notify us if your team is currently using this EKS cluster. If you require additional time to migrate your applications to a different environment, please inform us as soon as possible. This will allow us to postpone the upgrade if necessary to accommodate your needs.

If we do not receive timely notification, the upgrade will proceed as planned, and we will not be able to address any issues that may arise from the transition after the fact.

Next Steps:

Please respond at your earliest convenience if your team needs additional time or has concerns about this upgrade. Your feedback is crucial to ensure a smooth process and to avoid any unnecessary disruptions.

Context:

Our EKS cluster, initially provisioned on July 3, 2019, has not received upgrades or patches since its deployment. Over the years, the infrastructure, including the EDP Jenkins environment, has required significant manual interventions due to breakages and the lack of automated maintenance. AWS has recently discontinued support for EKS version 1.21 and automatically migrated our cluster to version 1.22. This forced upgrade has introduced potential risks, particularly around application stability upon restart.

Given these developments, it is critical that we perform a planned upgrade to EKS version 1.23. This upgrade is necessary to ensure the continued stability, security, and supportability of our infrastructure, especially for those stakeholders who still rely on this cluster during our broader migration efforts to new clusters.

Current State:

Cluster: EKS Cluster
Region: us-west-2
Current EKS Version: 1.22 (after AWS's automatic upgrade)
Upgrade Target: EKS Version 1.23
Risks and Challenges:

As with any major upgrade, there are several risks and challenges that we must anticipate and manage carefully:

Incompatibility Issues:
Potential Impact: Upgrading the Kubernetes version can introduce breaking changes that may be incompatible with existing applications or configurations.
Mitigation: This could necessitate additional adjustments or patches post-upgrade to ensure all applications function correctly. We plan to conduct thorough testing in a staging environment to identify and resolve these issues before the upgrade.
Downtime:
Potential Impact: The upgrade process could result in significant downtime, impacting all applications running within this cluster. Even with careful planning, some service interruptions are expected during the upgrade.
Mitigation: We will schedule the upgrade during off-peak hours to minimize disruption and will communicate the expected downtime well in advance to all stakeholders.
No Rollback Option:
Potential Impact: Once initiated, the upgrade process cannot be paused, canceled, or rolled back. Any issues encountered during the upgrade could result in prolonged outages or, in a worst-case scenario, permanent loss of applications.
Mitigation: We will have a dedicated team on standby to address any issues that arise immediately during the upgrade, minimizing the risk of extended outages.
Application Failures on Restart:
Potential Impact: Some applications may fail to restart correctly due to compatibility issues with the newer Kubernetes version. This could lead to service disruptions and potentially impact business operations.
Mitigation: By identifying and addressing these issues in a controlled staging environment before the upgrade, we aim to minimize this risk. Additionally, we will have rollback plans for individual applications where feasible, though a full rollback of the cluster is not possible.
Resource Constraints:
Potential Impact: The upgrade may place additional load on cluster resources, potentially leading to resource contention or performance degradation during the process.
Mitigation: We will monitor resource utilization closely throughout the upgrade and be prepared to adjust resource allocations as needed to ensure stability.
Data Integrity Risks:
Potential Impact: During the upgrade process, there is a small risk of data corruption or loss, particularly if any applications are not fully compatible with the new Kubernetes version.
Mitigation: We will perform comprehensive backups of all data and the cluster state prior to the upgrade, ensuring that we can restore any lost data if necessary.

Team,

We are undertaking a crucial upgrade of the EKS clusters within our EDP management AWS Account to enhance system integrity and security.

AWS has upgraded to version 1.22, which has introduced potential disruptions. Although some end users are currently utilizing these applications without reported issues, we must remain vigilant. To preemptively address any disruptions and ensure a seamless transition, we are planning a proactive migration to version 1.29. This upgrade is essential for maintaining compatibility with upcoming AWS updates and bolstering our overall system security.

While we anticipate that some applications may experience compatibility issues post-upgrade, we want to emphasize that resolving these issues may not always be within our control. The upgrade may result in certain applications breaking due to dependencies or compatibility problems. We will monitor the situation closely and address any issues that arise to the best of our abilities, but there may be limitations in our capacity to resolve all potential problems.
