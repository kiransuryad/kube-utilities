Inform Users and Timebox the Issue
Advantages: This approach encourages users to take responsibility for their resources, potentially reducing the administrative burden on you. It also establishes a clear deadline which can expedite compliance.
Risks: Users may not meet the deadline or may lack the technical expertise to encrypt the volumes themselves, which could leave unencrypted volumes in your environment past your compliance date.
2. Encrypt the Volumes Yourself
Advantages: Direct control over the encryption process ensures that all volumes are encrypted according to best practices and within a known timeframe.
Procedure:
Create snapshots of existing unencrypted EBS volumes.
Encrypt the snapshots.
Create new EBS volumes from the encrypted snapshots.
Swap the encrypted volumes with the original unencrypted ones.
Risks: The process can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if not automated. There's also the risk of application errors if the new encrypted volumes do not perform as expected.
3. Automate Encryption with AWS Lambda
Advantages: Automation reduces the manual workload and can be set to handle ongoing encryption needs, ensuring all new volumes are encrypted by default.
Risks: Requires initial setup and testing to ensure that the automation scripts function correctly across your varied environments. Misconfigurations can lead to data loss or downtime.
4. Delete Unencrypted Volumes After Warning
Advantages: This is the most stringent method to enforce security compliance. It removes any unencrypted data from your environment.
Procedure:
Notify users with a specific timeframe to either migrate their data or encrypt their volumes.
After the deadline, delete any remaining unencrypted volumes.
Risks: High risk of data loss if users do not comply or misunderstand the instructions. It may also disrupt operations if critical data or services rely on those volumes.
