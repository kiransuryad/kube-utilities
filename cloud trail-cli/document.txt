🔖 Runbook Name

keycloak

keycloak-ethos

📘 Runbook Description

Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution. Each instance is deployed inside a private EKS cluster, connecting to an external Aurora PostgreSQL RDS backend. The deployment follows a GitOps-based approach using Terraform, Helm, and Harness pipelines. Secrets are securely managed with Vault Agent Injector, and observability is enabled through kube-prometheus-stack and Loki.

TLS is enabled using cert-manager with a self-signed internal CA. Each deployment is encapsulated within its namespace, and additional tooling such as pgAdmin, netshoot, and metrics-server support diagnostics and scaling.

🧱 System Architecture

All services are deployed into a private EKS cluster

Services are isolated using Kubernetes namespaces

ALB → NGINX (NodePort) → Services

Internal TLS provided by cert-manager self-signed CA

Secrets injected via Vault Agent

Harness pipelines for Helm chart promotion

Prometheus/Grafana/Loki for observability

📛 Namespaces Overview

🔧 Service Components

1. Ingress-NGINX

Namespace: ingress-nginx

Deployed via Helm using NodePort + Proxy Protocol

Connected to internal NLB created via Terraform

Supports path-based routing

TLS handled by cert-manager ClusterIssuer

2. Certificate Manager

Namespace: cert-manager

Helm deployment using Jetstack chart

Creates internal self-signed ClusterIssuer

Handles TLS for ingress-enabled services

3. Vault Agent Injector

Namespace: keycloak-eda (injector installed cluster-wide)

Vault CLI runs in Harness pipeline to configure roles/policies

Secrets injected into pod environment/volumes

Avoids K8s secrets, supports TTL and rotation

4. Observability Stack

Namespace: kube-prometheus-stack

Helm chart: kube-prometheus-stack

Includes:

Prometheus (metrics)

Grafana (dashboards)

Alertmanager (alerts → AWS SNS)

Node Exporter, Kube State Metrics

Loki + Promtail deployed for centralized logs

Dashboards and alerts tailored for Keycloak, Vault, etc.

5. Harness Delegate

Namespace: harness-delegate-ng

Deployed manually via YAML

Vault CLI installed in Harness shell steps

Supports Helm deployments via JFrog-based chart promotion

6. Keycloak Deployment

Namespace: keycloak-eda

Helm chart: codecentric/keycloak

Admin creds, DB URL injected via Vault

TLS enabled ingress with /auth path

Connects to Aurora PostgreSQL (Terraform provisioned)

7. Velero Backup

Namespace: velero

Daily backups of persistent volume claims

Backup to S3 bucket with proper IAM roles

Restore tested for pgAdmin and tools pods

8. Kube-Debug Tools

Namespace: kube-debug-tools

Tools:

netshoot (debug pod)

vault-cli (token inspection)

pgAdmin (Postgres DB browsing)

httpbin (ingress header testing)

9. Metrics Server

Namespace: metrics-server

Enables resource metrics for HPA

Required by Grafana dashboards for live resource usage

✅ Summary

This setup provides a production-ready, observable, secure, and scalable deployment of Keycloak in EKS using Vault, cert-manager, and Harness. All components are namespace-isolated and designed for ease of maintenance and future extensibility.

Updates should be made in respective Helm values.yaml, Vault policy files, and Harness pipeline definitions.
